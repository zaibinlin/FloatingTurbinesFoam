![Image loading](./doc/Verification.png)

**FloatingTurbinesFoam** is a library for simulating floating offshore wind turbine's (FOWT) motion under wind-wave-current in OpenFOAM.

## Usage
Cases have been tested for OpenFOAM v2012 only.

Requires `olaFlow`: https://github.com/phicau/olaFlow.

Requires `foamMooring`: https://gitlab.com/hfchen20/foamMooring/-/tree/master/.

Requires `kOmegaSSTStable`: https://github.com/phicau/olaFlow_supplementary.

Requires `FloatingTurbine`: https://github.com/fronterapp/thesis-FloatingTurbine

Requires `OpenFOAM-v2012`


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dylan000112/FloatingTurbinesFoam.git
cd <project-directory>
./Allwmake
```
