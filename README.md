## 📖 Introduction
**FloatingTurbinesFoam** extends the capabilities of OpenFOAM to handle the complex fluid-structure interaction (FSI) required for floating offshore wind turbines. It specifically targets the dynamic response of FOWTs subjected to simultaneous wind, wave, and current loads, providing a robust framework for marine energy research.

## ✨ Features
- **Coupled Dynamics**: Simulates 6DOF motion of floating platforms.
- **Environmental Loads**: Integrated solvers for combined wind, wave, and current interactions.
- **Mooring Systems**: Coupling with dynamic mooring line solvers.
- **Turbine Aerodynamics**: Actuator line turbine modeling.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

This library relies on several third-party packages. Please ensure the following are installed and compiled **before** attempting to build FloatingTurbinesFoam.

| Dependency | Version | Link | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **OpenFOAM** | `v2012` | [OpenFOAM.com](https://www.openfoam.com/) | Base CFD framework (Strictly tested on v2012). |
| **olaFlow** | Latest | [GitHub](https://github.com/phicau/olaFlow) | Wave generation and absorption. |
| **foamMooring**| Master | [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/hfchen20/foamMooring/-/tree/master/) | Mooring restraints for rigid body motions. |
| **kOmegaSSTStable** | - | [GitHub](https://github.com/phicau/olaFlow_supplementary) | Stabilized turbulence model for wave simulations. |
| **FloatingTurbine** | - | [GitHub](https://github.com/fronterapp/thesis-FloatingTurbine) | Base libraries from Pere Frontera's thesis. |

> [!WARNING]
> This repository is currently verified **only for OpenFOAM v2012**. Compatibility with other versions (e.g., v2112, v2206) is not guaranteed and may require source code modification.

## 🚀 Installation

### 1. Download Source Code
Clone this repository or copy the source folder to your OpenFOAM user directory (`$WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR`).

```bash
# Option A: Git Clone (Recommended)
cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR
git clone https://github.com/Dylan000112/FloatingTurbinesFoam.git

# Option B: Manual Copy
# Assuming you have the folder 'FloatingTurbinesFoam' locally
cp -r FloatingTurbinesFoam $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/
```

### 2. Compile
Navigate to the directory and execute the compilation script. Ensure your OpenFOAM environment is sourced (e.g., `source /opt/openfoam2012/etc/bashrc`).

```bash
cd $WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR/FloatingTurbinesFoam

# Clean previous builds (optional)
./Allwclean

# Compile library and solvers
./Allwmake
```

## 💻 Usage

To run a simulation, ensure that your case structure includes the necessary dictionaries for `olaFlow` and `foamMooring`.

Typical workflow:
1. Prepare the mesh (`blockMesh`, `snappyHexMesh`).
2. Set up wave properties in `constant/waveDict`.
3. Set up mooring properties in `constant/dynamicMeshDict`.
4. Run the solver.

*(Refer to the source code `tutorials` folder if available for example setups).*
