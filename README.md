[**FloatingporousFoam**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D-EE6wJXsYc) is a library for simulating porous structure's motion under wave and current in OpenFOAM.

## Usage
Cases have been tested for OpenFOAM v2206 only.

Requires `olaFlow`: https://github.com/phicau/olaFlow.

For the moored-floating porous sturcture case, requires `foamMooring`: https://gitlab.com/hfchen20/foamMooring/-/tree/master/.

## Installation
1. Copy the `floatingporousFoam` floder to `$WM_PROJECT_USER_DIR`.
2. Run `./Allwmake`.
3. Include the following lines in your `contorlDict`:
   
   `libs
      (
        poroussixDoFRigidBodyMotion
      );`

4. Run your case with `porousolaDyMFlow`
